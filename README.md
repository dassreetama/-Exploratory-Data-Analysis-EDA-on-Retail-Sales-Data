# Retail Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The goal is to help the retail business make informed decisions based on the analysis.

## Dataset

The project uses two datasets:
1. **Retail Sales Dataset** - Contains transaction details including sales amounts, customer demographics, and product categories.
2. **Menu Dataset** - Contains nutritional information of various menu items.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - Load the datasets.
   - Inspect the columns and clean the data by handling missing values and correcting data types.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for sales and calories.

3. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.

4. **Customer and Product Analysis**:
   - Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
   - Identify top spending customers and top-selling product categories.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualize insights using bar charts for top spending customers and top-selling product categories.

6. **Recommendations**:
   - Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis to help improve sales and customer satisfaction.
